# Reflect Skill

Analyze the current conversation and propose improvements to skills based on what worked, what didn't, and edge cases discovered.

## Trigger

Run `/reflect` or `/reflect [skill-name]` after a session where you used a skill.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Skill

If skill name not provided, ask:

```
Which skill should I analyze this session for?
- frontend-design
- code-reviewer
- [other]
```

### Step 2: Analyze the Conversation

Look for these signals in the current conversation:

**Corrections** (HIGH confidence):
- User said "no", "not like that", "I meant..."
- User explicitly corrected output
- User asked for changes immediately after generation

**Successes** (MEDIUM confidence):
- User said "perfect", "great", "yes", "exactly"
- User accepted output without modification
- User built on top of the output

**Edge Cases** (MEDIUM confidence):
- Questions the skill didn't anticipate
- Scenarios requiring workarounds
- Features user asked for that weren't covered

**Preferences** (accumulate over sessions):
- Repeated patterns in user choices
- Style preferences shown implicitly
- Tool/framework preferences

### Step 3: Propose Changes

Present findings using accessible colors (WCAG AA 4.5:1 contrast ratio):

```
┌─ Skill Reflection: [skill-name] ─────────────────┐
│                                                   │
│  Signals: X corrections, Y successes              │
│                                                   │
│  Proposed changes:                                │
│                                                   │
│  ● [HIGH] + Add constraint: "[specific constraint]"│
│  ● [MED]  + Add preference: "[specific preference]"│
│  ● [LOW]  ~ Note for review: "[observation]"      │
│                                                   │
│  Commit: "[skill]: [summary of changes]"          │

└───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Apply these changes? [Y/n] or describe tweaks
```

**Accessible Color Palette** (use ANSI codes in terminal output):
- HIGH: `\033[1;31m` (bold red #FF6B6B - 4.5:1 on dark)
- MED: `\033[1;33m` (bold yellow #FFE066 - 4.8:1 on dark)
- LOW: `\033[1;36m` (bold cyan #6BC5FF - 4.6:1 on dark)
- Reset: `\033[0m`

Avoid: pure red (#FF0000) on black, green on red (colorblind users)

Options:
- Y — Apply changes, commit, and push
- n — Skip this update
- Or describe any tweaks to the proposed changes

### Step 4: If Approved

1. Read the current skill file from `~/.claude/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`
2. Apply the changes using the Edit tool
3. Run git commands:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills
git add [skill-name]/SKILL.md
git commit -m "[skill]: [change summary]"
git push origin main
```

4. Confirm: "Skill updated and pushed to GitHub"

### Step 5: If Declined

Ask: "Would you like to save these observations for later review?"

If yes, append to `~/.claude/skills/[skill-name]/OBSERVATIONS.md`

## Example Session

User runs `/reflect frontend-design` after a UI session:

## Git Integration

This skill has permission to:
- Read skill files from `~/.claude/skills/`
- Edit skill files (with user approval)
- Run `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` in the skills directory

The skills repo should be initialized at `~/.claude/skills` with a remote origin.

## Important Notes

- Always show the exact changes before applying
- Never modify skills without explicit user approval
- Commit messages should be concise and descriptive
- Push only after successful commit
